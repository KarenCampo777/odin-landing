# Odin Project Landing Page

This landing page was made as a learning activity to practice what I learned about HTML and CSS. This landing page is about myself as a developer and as a theater actress. The “Call to Action” section and its adaptability posed a special challenge for me. I realize that I need to work a bit more on my web development skills which make me very enthusiastic about learning more. My gratitude to the Odin Project
