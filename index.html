                        my
                        journey as a junior developer. My
                        background, however, is not in tech—it’s in art. I spent many years as a theater actress, where
                        the
                        stage became the love of my life. Transitioning from the spotlight to coding wasn’t easy, but
                        it’s
                        been
                        a rewarding and creative challenge.<br>

                        Let me share my story and show you the work that reflects my passion for both art and
                        technology.

                    <p>Theater Actress

                        With a wide participation in plays, I have explored the classical dramaturgy in theater and
                        literature, seeking also in an alternative way that in all possible dimensions and in
                        literature, seeking also in an alternative way that in all possible and different dimensions,
                        from the classical and academic to the
                        different dimensions, from the classical and academic to the innovative, searching for a
                        theatrical language that is “Katarchic”.
                        “Katarquica”.</p>

                    <h3>Techie Lover</h3>
                    <p>I may still be an amateur, but I am fascinated by the limitless possibilities that technology
                        offers.
                        Like art, technology is a kind of magic, it is creating from nothing more than the capabilities
                        of
                        our own minds. Of course, discipline is necessary, but without creativity nothing interesting
                        comes
                        out of it.

                    <p>With significant experience in web development, I am looking to expand my skills and reach higher
                        levels in software develpment</p>

                    <p>As a former actress and technology enthusiast, I understand the value of working with others, of
                        listening carefully and of reciprocity to realize those dreams collectively.</p>
